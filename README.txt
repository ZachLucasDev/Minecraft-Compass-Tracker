This Tracker will allow you to specif a specific player to track. It is very easy to use. Well they are tracked, if a player right clicks with a compass in either one of their hands it will point to the tracked players current location. This can only be done every 30 seconds. If the tracked player is within 30 blocks (x and z) It will not track the player and instead inform the user that they are close.

Functions:

/Track_Player [player] : This is how you specify the player to be tracked

/Track_Debug : Just used for debug info. Not useful unless you know how to edit the plugin.

INSTALL:

Just exstract the CompassTracking-1.0.0 to your plugin folder on your Buildkit Server
